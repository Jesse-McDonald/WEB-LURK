# WEB-LURK
WEB-LURK is a browser based Lurk client.
WEB-LURK has a node.js based client "server" that acts as a go between between the browser and the binary LURK protocal.
The client "client" is html, jquery, websockets, and css.

The client is designed to connect to lurk servers using the custom LURK protocal.  For a description of lurk protocal see http://isoptera.lcsc.edu/~seth/cs435/lurk_2.2.html
Currently the client supports up to LURK 2.2 and sends HTML and HTML5 in the extension list
 
This  client is a continuation of https://github.com/Jesse-McDonald/LURK-Client/ done for fun.
